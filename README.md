# RiverMonitoringIOT
A Hydro-Electric IOT mobile application built for flood detection using blynk libraries

## IOT

The generator housing has been removed to demonstrate the Light switching from green(safe) to red(danger) if the flow exceeds the given rate.

The following is a prototype IOT mobile application using blynk libraries to create a water flow rate monitor. This application displays:
-Date
-Flow Rate (Gauge)
-Flow rate (Bar chart)
-Chart to track previous flow over dynamic time frames
-Terminal

The terminal allows for a direct interface with the IOT device enabling the use of progammable commands. One exemplary command is 'voltage' which outputs the voltage of the device.
